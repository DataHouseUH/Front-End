# How to Publish to a folder using Visual Studio
1. First clone or download the Front-End Display Repository.
2. In the root folder of Front-Display, open the Front-End.csproj using Visual Studio.
3. On the navigation panel, click Build -> Publish Front-End. Then publish it as a folder (this might take some time).
4. After publishing, open the folder that you created while doing the publishing step (step 3).
5. Inside the folder there should be a Front-End.exe. Open this file.
6. Now, Front-End should be deployed locally.
